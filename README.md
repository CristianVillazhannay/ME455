# ME455: Active Learning in Robotics

## Class Description:
Active learning takes advantage of control authority to improve data as it is being acquired.  Robotics applications are particularly sensitive to how data is taken.  For instance, machine vision is obviously dependent on where a camera is pointed, and learning algorithms cannot independently overcome a camera pointing in an incorrect direction.  This class will cover recent results in control, planning, and machine learning, focusing on creating a closed-loop relationship between information needs and physical actions of a robot.  Some of the course will be in lecture format, and a significant portion of the course will be reading current papers in the area.  Students should have strong programming skills and experience in robotics.

## Application:
This is where I have compiled my homework and other assignments. Each homework is drafted in a Jupyter Notebook where the concept is explained and the code commented.
